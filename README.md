# TaskList
A task manager written in C# / .NET using Visual Studio Community 2019. Part of a goal of mine to learn the framework.

## Functions
This Windows Console application lets you add tasks, view exisitng tasks and remove tasks from the list. Created tasks are automatically
sorted by date with most recent at the bottom. Tasks are also serialized, meaning data is persistent across program launches.

* [x] Functioning task auto-sort by date
* [x] Data persistence
